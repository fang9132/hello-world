Project description, purpose of the program, creator name, version number, date of creation, program usage instructions

This program is a very simple java application. 
It was made in mind of college students who would like to know their GPA. 
The program asks for the name, student id, and if they’re full-time or part-time students. 
There are about 6 boxes for 6 classes a student might be taking. 
They enter the grade and select the credit for each course. Then, you just hit the calculate button. 
This little program will be so much easier for students to stay current on their GPAs and they don’t need to waste time seeing a counselor physically.
I created this program. My pretend software company that created this program is Fang Solutions. 
This is a program that was created for my Java class.
I created this program on Feb 4, 2019. This is the very first version.
The program is kind of complete and still not super clean.
